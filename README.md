# Netshoes Cart Test

## Expected result

* See a list of products;
* Be able to add or remove items to the cart and get instant visual feedback;
* See the products added to the cart.

## Data

The data we provide is a static JSON file under `/public/data`.

## Notes

* You can use whatever stack or tooling you want to help you;
* Feel free to ask us questions during the process (but trust your guts, please!);
* You should create a static server in order to access the JSON data provided.

## Bonus

* Persist data on page reload;
* Test your code;
* Instructions on how to build/run the project.


## To run test

You just need from a Unix OS go into the folder by terminal and type:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

It will open a native Simple Server on port 8000. Go  to the browser and type: localhost:8000

That's all! Thank you!
